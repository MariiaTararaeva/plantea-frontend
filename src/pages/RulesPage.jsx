      <h1>🌿 Welcome to the Green Thumb Forum! 🌿</h1>

      <p>
        We're thrilled to have you in our little garden of plant lovers! To keep
        this space healthy and thriving, here are a few friendly guidelines to
        follow:
      </p>

      <h2>🌱 Rooted in Respect</h2>
      <p>
        Be kind to fellow plant enthusiasts! Just like plants need the right
        environment to grow, our community thrives on positivity and respect. No
        wilting words, please!
      </p>

      <h2>🌿 Stay on Topic</h2>
      <p>
        We’re here to talk about plants, gardening, and all things green. Let’s
        keep our conversations growing in the right direction!
      </p>

      <h2>🌾 No Toxic Chemicals (or Behavior!)</h2>
      <p>
        Harassment, hate speech, and negativity won’t be tolerated at all. Keep
        the air fresh and the vibes positive!
      </p>

      <h2>🌸 Help Each Other Bloom</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're a seasoned gardener or just starting out, we all have
        something to learn. Share tips, ask questions, and support each other's
        growth!
      </p>

      <h2>🌵 No Spamming—We’re Not a Weed Patch!</h2>
      <p>
        Avoid excessive self-promotion, irrelevant links, or flooding threads
        with off-topic content. We love organic discussions, not invasive
        species!
      </p>

      <h2>🍃 Keep It Clean & Friendly</h2>
      <p>
        No harmful advice, false information, or anything that might cause more
        harm than good to plants—or people!
      </p>

      <h2>🌻 Have Fun and Let Your Knowledge Grow!</h2>
      <p>
        Enjoy the forum, explore new plant care techniques, and don’t be afraid
        to get your hands dirty (virtually speaking)!
